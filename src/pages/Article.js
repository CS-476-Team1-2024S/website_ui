                        Pick someone to shuffle and deal the cards for the first round. Go Fish is great because it can be played with as few as 2 players and up to as many as 6 players. The dealer could be the person whose birthday is coming up next, the person who won the last game, or someone else you choose.<sup>[1]</sup>

                        Try to take turns being the dealer so that one person doesnâ€™t get stuck doing it every time.
